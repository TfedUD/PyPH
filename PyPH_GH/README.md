# PyPH_GH
The PyPH_GH Grasshopper components are pre-made components which allow users to add Passive House data to existing LadybugTools models. These tools are designed to be used 'in-line' with the existing LBT components. They do not *replace* the LBT tools, they merely extend the functionality and allow for additional Passive-House specific attributes and object parameters.


## PyPH_Compatability:
* All components are developed in Rhino Version 7 (SR8: 7.8.21196.5001, 2021-07-15) or better. Grasshopper Build 1.0.0007 (2021) 

## Usage:
* Components here are designed to be used within the Rhino/Grasshopper environment. 
.ghuser files and .py files are provided. The .ghuser files can be loaded into Grasshopper directly and used from within the platform. 
* The .py component source code is provided for documentation / reference purposes only.

## Install:
1. Download the .ghuser components
1. Copy these files to your system's **UserObjects** folder.
    * On most systems, this folder can be found at:
    > C:\Users\\ {*your-user-name*} \AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\UserObjects
1. If you like, in order to keep the folder tidy, you can put these files inside a subfolder. For instance:
1. Once installed, reboot Rhino and Grasshopper and you should have a new tab ('PH-Tools') within Grasshopper.
